# Keepshire — Feature Catalog

**Purpose:** This is the canonical technical inventory of every product and system feature in Keepshire. Use it as the baseline for **any** iOS/Xcode upgrade (iOS 27, 28, 29, …). Do not treat README marketing bullets as complete.

**How to use this document for an OS upgrade**

1. Treat every row in [Feature inventory](#feature-inventory) as a regression requirement. If it exists here, it must still work after the upgrade.
2. For each feature, check the listed **Apple APIs / frameworks** against Apple’s latest release notes, deprecations, and Human Interface Guidelines.
3. If an API is deprecated or removed, record the replacement in an upgrade plan (separate document). Do not change behavior unless the OS forces it.
4. After implementation, run the [Upgrade verification checklist](#upgrade-verification-checklist).
5. When a feature is added or removed in the app, **update this file in the same change**.

## 1. Product overview

Keepshire is a **local, encrypted file vault** for iOS. Users store photos, videos, audio, documents, and other files on-device. Access is gated by a passcode or password, optionally Face ID / Touch ID. Files are encrypted at rest with a key derived from the vault credential.

There is **no cloud sync, widgets, or App Intents**. The Share Extension uses an App Group inbox to stage files; the main app encrypts them only after a real-vault unlock. The only network feature is an optional **LAN HTTPS server** for browser upload/download on the same Wi‑Fi.

Architecture: SwiftUI app (`KeepshireApp` → `ContentView` → `AuthenticationCoordinator` → `MainTabView`), MVVM view models, protocol-based `DependencyContainer`, Core Data for metadata, encrypted files on disk.

The Xcode project is `Keepshire.xcodeproj`, the app source folder is `Keepshire`, and the Core Data model is `Keepshire`. `com.haresh.keepshire` is a different app from any previous `com.haresh.FileVault` install: Keychain and vault files do not migrate.

### 1.1 App Store Connect listing

These values live in App Store Connect, not in the binary (except the home-screen name).

| Field | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Name (30) | Keepshire: Private Photo Vault |
| Subtitle (30) | Hide photos, videos & files |
| Keywords | `gallery,locker,album,encrypted,passcode,secure,folder,document,audio,secret,lock` |
| Handle | @keepshire |

## 2. Platform baseline (what an OS upgrade must preserve)

### 2.1 Targets and project settings

| Setting | Current value | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` | 18.5 | Set on the project, app target, and unit-test target. The UI-test target does not set its own value (inherits the project 18.5). |
| `SWIFT_VERSION` | 5.0 | Project setting (not “Swift 5.9+”) |
| `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` | NO | Checked-in `Keepshire/Info.plist` |
| `CFBundleDisplayName` | Keepshire | Home-screen and SpringBoard name |
| `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` | `Use Face ID to unlock Keepshire` | Face ID unlock |
| `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` | `Keepshire uses the local network so you can upload files from a browser on the same Wi-Fi.` | LAN web upload |
| `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` | `YES` | AES-GCM at rest and LAN TLS; App Store Connect export answers must match |
| `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` | UserDefaults CA92.1; no tracking or collected data | App-only preferences; no account or analytics |
| `UIBackgroundModes` | Not declared | In-flight LAN uploads use finite `beginBackgroundTask` time |
| Scene manifest | Multiple scenes disabled | One SwiftUI `WindowGroup`; no second unlocked vault window |
| Policy / support URLs | `https://keepshire.haresh.dev/privacy`, `https://keepshire.haresh.dev/support` | Settings → About |
| Launch screen | Explicit empty `UILaunchScreen` dictionary | Required when linking with iOS 27 SDK |
| Signing | Automatic | Team `AYL8H487NP` |
| Entitlements | App Group only | `group.com.haresh.keepshire`; no iCloud, associated domains, or push entitlement |

No Bonjour services are advertised, so `NSBonjourServices` is not declared.

### 2.2 Apple frameworks in use

| Framework | Used for |
|-----------|----------|
| SwiftUI | Entire UI, scene lifecycle (`scenePhase`) |
| UIKit | Window overlay, alerts, `UIActivityViewController`, `UIDocumentPicker`, `PHPicker`, graphics renderers, screenshot / capture notifications, finite background task |
| Core Data | `Folder`, `VaultItem` metadata |
| CryptoKit | AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt |
| CommonCrypto | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation |
| Security (Keychain) | Real and fake credentials; `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`; LAN TLS identity for the duration of a web-upload session |
| LocalAuthentication | Face ID / Touch ID |
| PhotosUI | `PHPickerViewController` (images + videos, limit 50) |
| Photos | `PHAsset` import path on `FileStorageManager` / `PhotoImportService` (primary UI path is `PHPicker` + `VaultImportService`) |
| UniformTypeIdentifiers | MIME/UTI mapping; document picker types |
| AVFoundation / AVKit | Video/audio playback, video thumbnails, player controls, `AVAudioSession` playback category for audio |
| MediaPlayer | Imported in `AudioPreviewView` but unused (no Now Playing / remote commands) |
| QuickLook | Document / unsupported file preview |
| PDFKit | Document preview |
| Network | `NWListener` local HTTPS server on port **8080** (TLS 1.2+, per-session self-signed cert) |
| UserNotifications | Upload completion (alert, badge, sound) |
| CoreMotion | Shake-to-lock accelerometer |
| Core Image | QR code generation (`CIQRCodeGenerator`) |
| Combine | ViewModels |

### 2.3 Storage locations and protection

| Path / store | Protection | Encrypted by app? |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| `Documents/Vault/` | `FileProtectionType.complete` | Yes — AES-GCM. Files under 16 MB are a single combined sealed box. Larger files use a `KSHC` chunked layout (1 MB plaintext chunks). Filenames on disk are the item UUID, not the display name. Imports above 2 GB are rejected. |
| `Documents/Thumbnails/` | `FileProtectionType.complete` | Yes — AES-GCM combined sealed boxes named `{uuid}.thumb` (200×200 JPEG @ 0.7 before encryption) |
| `Documents/Keepshire.sqlite` (+ WAL/SHM) | `completeUntilFirstUserAuthentication` | Display names, MIME types, and sizes are AES-GCM sealed JSON on each row (`sealedMetadata`). Search uses the decrypted copies in RAM after unlock. The store, `Documents/Vault/`, and `Documents/Thumbnails/` are excluded from iCloud/computer backup. |
| Keychain items `com.haresh.keepshire` | `WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` | System Keychain (credential + PBKDF2 salt/parameters) |
| UserDefaults | Standard suite | Settings, auth type, lock timeout, trash flag, security logs, biometric enabled |

**Encryption details**

- Key = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 of the real credential (210,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt, 32-byte key). Salt and parameters live in Keychain account `vaultKeyDerivation` (`WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`).
- Cipher: `AES.GCM.seal` / `AES.GCM.open` (combined nonce + ciphertext + tag) for vault files, thumbnails, and Core Data `sealedMetadata` JSON. Vault blobs at or above 16 MB are stored as versioned `KSHC` chunked sealed boxes so import does not hold the whole file in RAM.
- Changing authentication generates a new salt and **re-encrypts every vault file** (`migrateFilesToNewEncryptionKey`) with a progress UI (`MigrationProgressView`). Re-encrypted copies are staged as `.migrating` files and committed only after every blob succeeds; a failure leaves the previous key and original ciphertext in place. Item and folder metadata blobs are re-sealed with the new key after that commit.
- Core Data `save()` throws instead of crashing the process. A store that fails to load shows an error overlay on launch.
- Share and preview decrypt into `tmp/keepshire-share/<session>/`. Those directories are removed when the share sheet finishes, when the vault locks, and on the next unlock.
- If ciphertext exists but no derivation record is in Keychain, unlock derives a SHA-256 key long enough to open those files, then re-encrypts them with PBKDF2 and stores a salt.
- Duplicate display names in a folder get a suffix (`name (n).ext`). Each item has its own UUID blob on disk. Display name, MIME type, and size live in sealed JSON; gallery search filters decrypted `fileName` values in memory.
- Permanent delete removes the item's ciphertext and thumbnail from disk. Unlock also deletes vault files and thumbnails that no item claims; the sweep is skipped when the vault has no items.
- Unlock encrypts leftover plaintext JPEG thumbnails in place with the vault key, and seals leftover plaintext Core Data names into `sealedMetadata`.

---

## 3. User flows

### 3.1 First launch

1. `AppDataManager.isFirstLaunch` is true.
2. `performFirstLaunchCleanup()` wipes vault files and thumbnails, Keychain, UserDefaults (except launch flag), and Core Data.
3. Sets **`trashEnabled = true`**.
4. User must choose an authentication type, then set the credential.

DEBUG Settings can simulate this cleanup.

### 3.2 Unlock

Order of gates in `ContentView`:

1. Auth type set?
2. Password/passcode set?
3. Authenticated?

If biometrics are enabled and available, Face ID / Touch ID runs first (0.3s delay). Cancel / failure falls back to `PasscodeView` (numeric OTP UI or alphanumeric password field, depending on auth type). The loading screen `BiometricCheckView` always shows the **Face ID** SF Symbol, even on Touch ID devices. Users with a stored password but no auth type are treated as `.password`.

On **every** successful unlock (biometric, real passcode, or fake passcode), `FileStorageManager.setupEncryptionKey(from:)` is called with the **real** Keychain password. Fake login does not derive a different key; it only hides data in the UI.

### 3.3 Background / lock

- On resign active / background: `ContentView` shows `EnhancedPrivacyOverlay`, an **opaque** lock-shield cover in the brand gradient (`KeepshireTheme.brandScrim`); it hides the vault completely rather than tinting it. Separately, if screenshot protection is on, `SecurityManager` presents a full-screen black `UIWindow` overlay. Both can appear together. `setLastBackgroundTime()` is recorded.
- On foreground: if `shouldRequireAuthentication()` → lock, reset fake-login state, re-prompt.
- Immediate (0s): always re-auth.
- Never (−1): no auto re-auth.
- Default if never configured: **30 seconds**.
- Shake / flip / manual security events post `TriggerSecurityLock` and force lock.

## 4. Feature inventory

Every item below is a **must-keep** behavior unless product explicitly drops it.

### 4.1 Authentication and credentials

| ID | Feature | User-visible behavior | Implementation | Apple APIs |
|----|---------|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| A1 | Choose auth type | First launch: 6-digit passcode is selected by default; 4-digit passcode and alphanumeric password remain available. Setup warns that forgotten credentials cannot be recovered. | `AuthTypeSelectionView`, stored in UserDefaults `authenticationType` | SwiftUI |
| A2 | 4-digit passcode setup | Numeric only, exact length 4, confirm step, OTP-style fields + custom number pad. Explicitly described as weaker than 6-digit. | `PasscodeSetupView`, `OTPStylePasscodeView`, `CustomNumberPadView` | SwiftUI |
| A3 | 6-digit passcode setup | Same as A2, length 6 | same | SwiftUI |
| A4 | Password setup | Minimum **6** characters, confirmation, strength UI | `PasswordSetupView` | SwiftUI |
| A5 | Store credential | Saved in Keychain, this-device-only, not iCloud Keychain sync | `KeychainManager.savePassword`, service `com.haresh.keepshire`, account `userPassword` | Security.framework |
| A6 | Unlock with passcode/password | Custom UI, not system passcode sheet | `PasscodeView` | SwiftUI |
| A7 | Enable Face ID / Touch ID | Settings toggle; disabled if hardware/enrollment unavailable. `LABiometryType` only maps `.faceID` and `.touchID`; any other type (including Optic ID if present) is treated as `.none` | `BiometricAuthManager`, UserDefaults `biometricEnabled` | LocalAuthentication (`LAContext`) |
| A8 | Biometric unlock | Prompt on foreground if enabled; cancel title **"Use Password"**; `localizedFallbackTitle = ""` (no Enter Password / device-passcode fallback on the biometric policy). Success always sets **real** login | `AuthenticationCoordinator` | `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics` |
| A9 | Biometric lockout | After **3** failures, blocked for **30 seconds** | `maxFailureAttempts`, `failureResetInterval` | LocalAuthentication |
| A10 | Change authentication | Verify current credential → pick new type → set new credential → re-encrypt all files | `ChangeAuthenticationView`, `MigrationProgressView` | CryptoKit + Core Data |
| A11 | Auto-lock timeout | Picker: Immediately, 5s, 10s, 15s, 30s, 1 min, 5 min, Never | `KeychainManager.LockTimeout` | Scene phase / UIApplication notifications |
| A12 | Privacy overlay when leaving app | Opaque branded cover so app switcher does not show vault contents | `EnhancedPrivacyOverlay` in `ContentView` | `scenePhase`, `willResignActive` |

**Not wired in the main unlock UI:** `authenticateWithDevicePasscode` exists on `BiometricAuthManager` but is unused.

### 4.2 Decoy (fake) vault

| ID | Feature | User-visible behavior | Implementation | Apple APIs |
|----|---------|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| D1 | Set fake password/passcode | Must differ from the real credential; same format as current auth type | Keychain account `fakePassword` | Security |
| D2 | Change / remove fake credential | Settings: set, change, remove; status Set / Not Set | `SettingsView` | — |
| D3 | Fake login | Entering the fake credential unlocks an **empty** vault | `validatePassword` → `(isValid, isFakeLogin)`; `LoginStateManager` | — |
| D4 | Fake-login restrictions | No add files, no create folders, no web server, Settings shows **About only** | `canAddFiles`, `canCreateFolders`, `canAccessFullSettings`, server HTTP 403 | — |
| D5 | Fake credential cleared on auth change | Changing real auth method deletes fake password and prompts to set a new one | `SettingsView` change-auth callback | — |

Fake login does **not** use a second encrypted store. ViewModels return empty lists (folders, gallery, categories, trash). Mutations and the web server are blocked. The real encryption key is still loaded.

### 4.3 Device security protections

| ID | Feature | Default | Behavior | Apple APIs |
|----|---------|---------|----------|------------|
| S1 | Screenshot blanking | On | Vault stays visible and unchanged on the device. The app window's layer renders inside a secure text-entry canvas, so system screenshots of the window — including sheets, pickers, and full-screen previews — come out blank. After a shot, a single alert explains the blank image — repeat notifications for one capture are collapsed into one notice and one log entry. The alert runs only when this toggle is on | `ScreenCaptureBlanker`, `UITextField.isSecureTextEntry`, `UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification` |
| S2 | App Switcher cover | On | Extra black overlay window while inactive **if** screenshot protection is enabled | `willResignActive` / `didBecomeActive`, `SecurityOverlayWindow` at `alert + 1` |
| S3 | Screen recording protection | On | While the screen is captured **and** recording protection is enabled, a black cover window stays up. The cover is reference-counted by reason, so returning from the App Switcher does not drop it, and capture state is re-checked on activation | `UIScreen.capturedDidChangeNotification`, `UIWindowScene.screen.isCaptured` |
| S4 | Shake to lock | Off | Accelerometer magnitude > **2.5** → lock | CoreMotion `CMMotionManager`, interval 0.1s |
| S5 | Flip to lock | Off | Transition into `UIDeviceOrientation.faceDown` → lock | `UIDevice.orientationDidChangeNotification` |
| S6 | Security logs | — | Last **100** strings in UserDefaults `SecurityLogs` (debug-oriented, not shown in Settings UI) | UserDefaults |

Toggles live in Settings → Advanced Security. Screenshot, recording, shake, and flip each write UserDefaults when changed. After relaunch, screenshot and recording default to **on** if no value has been stored.

### 4.4 Main navigation

Five tabs (`MainTabView`):

| Tab | Label | Root view | Role |
|-----|--------|-----------|------|
| 0 | Folder | `FolderView` → `FolderContentView` | Nested folder browser |
| 1 | Category | `CategoryView` → `CategoryFilesView` | Type-based groups |
| 2 | Gallery | `VaultMainView` | Flat grid of all non-trashed files |
| 3 | Web Upload | `WebUploadTabView` | LAN server; badge `●` when running; globe icon changes |
| 4 | Settings | `SettingsView` | Embedded tab (not a sheet) |

Changing tabs posts `TabDidChange`, which **clears multi-select** in list/grid screens.

### 4.5 Folders

| ID | Feature | Behavior | APIs |
|----|---------|----------|------|
| F1 | Nested folders | `parent` / `subfolders`; breadcrumbs; `NavigationStack` path | Core Data |
| F2 | Create folder | Alert / empty state / Add Content sheet | Core Data |
| F3 | Rename folder | Context menu (also Select / Move / Delete on selectable rows) | Core Data |
| F4 | Delete folder | If trash on: nested **files** go to trash at **root** (`folder = nil`); folder records are deleted. If trash off: permanent cascade (`deleteFolderCompletely`) | Core Data + FileStorage |
| F5 | Move folder | Folder picker; cannot move into self or descendants | `CoreDataManager.moveFolder` |
| F6 | Sort folders and files | User Default, Name, Date, Size, Kind, Favorites + ascending/descending toggle | `FolderSortOption` |
| F7 | Empty state | Create folder / add files CTAs | `EmptyStateView` |
| F8 | Swipe to delete | Trailing swipe on folder and file rows; full-swipe allowed only when trash is **off** | SwiftUI `swipeActions` |
| F9 | Folder multi-select | Select All, Move, Delete on folders in selection mode | `FolderViewModel` |

### 4.6 Files — import

| ID | Feature | Behavior | Apple APIs |
|----|---------|----------|------------|
| I1 | Import photos & videos | System photo picker; images **and** videos; **max 50**; `preferredAssetRepresentationMode = .current` | PhotosUI `PHPickerViewController` via `VaultImportService` — **no** `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (picker is out-of-process) |
| I2 | Import files | Files app / document picker; multi-select; security-scoped read | `UIDocumentPickerViewController` for `image`, `movie`, `video`, `pdf`, `text`, `data` |
| I3 | Web import | Browser upload into current/root folder (see 4.11) | Network.framework HTTP |
| I4 | Duplicate detection | Same `fileSize` + `fileType` in **target folder** → `FileStorageError.duplicateFile` | — |
| I5 | Name collision | Auto-rename `name (n).ext` | — |
| I6 | Import progress overlay | Progress UI during gallery/folder imports | `ImportProgressView` |
| I7 | Thumbnails | Images and videos: 200×200 JPEG @ 0.7, AES-GCM encrypted as `{uuid}.thumb`; videos get a play overlay | `ThumbnailGenerationService`, `EncryptedFileStore`, `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`, AVFoundation image generator |

**Not implemented:** in-app camera / microphone capture (`UIImagePickerController` / `AVCaptureSession` are not used). Import is library + Files + web only.

MIME detection: `FileStorageManager.determineFileType(from:)` by extension; UTI conversion for Photos.

### 4.7 Files — organize, search, share

| ID | Feature | Behavior | APIs |
|----|---------|----------|------|
| O1 | Rename file | Alert; updates the display `fileName` in Core Data. The encrypted blob and encrypted thumbnail stay `{uuid}` / `{uuid}.thumb` on disk | `FileStorageManager.renameFile` |
| O2 | Move file | Universal / gallery folder pickers | Core Data relationship |
| O3 | Favorite | Toggle `isFavorite`; heart in viewer and lists | Core Data |
| O4 | Share / export | Decrypt to temp file → share sheet | `UIActivityViewController`, `ShareManager`, `prepareForSharing` |
| O5 | Delete | Trash if enabled; else permanent delete of the Core Data row, the UUID blob, and the thumbnail | Core Data + FileStorage |
| O6 | Search | **Gallery**, **Category files**, and the **Folder browser** use SwiftUI `.searchable`. Folder search matches decrypted file names and immediate child-folder names. | SwiftUI searchable |
| O7 | Sort files | User Default, Name, Size, Date, Kind, Favorites | `SortOption` / `FolderSortOption` |
| O8 | Multi-select | Long-press or “Select”; Select All; Favorite, Share, Move, Delete | Selection toolbars / floating bar |
| O9 | Context menu (file) | Select, Favorite/Unfavorite, Rename, Move, Share, Delete | SwiftUI contextMenu |
| O10 | Grid / list presentation | Gallery grid (`VaultGridView` / `VaultItemCell`); folder rows | SwiftUI |

Add Content sheet (Gallery and Folders, hidden on fake login): Photos & Videos, Files, Web Upload (Gallery also presents `WebUploadView` as a sheet), Create Folder (folders only). **Category files screens do not offer import/add.**

### 4.8 Categories

`CategoryType` (counts exclude trashed items):

| Category | Matching rule |
|----------|----------------|
| Favorites | `isFavorite` |
| Photos | `isImage` (`fileType` prefix `image/`) |
| Videos | Explicit video MIME list (mp4, quicktime, m4v, mpeg, mkv, avi, webm, flv, wmv, 3gpp) |
| Audio | mp3, wav, m4a, aac, ogg, flac MIME list |
| Documents | pdf, Office, text, rtf, zip/rar/7z MIME list |
| Other | Not image/video/audio/document |
| All Files | All non-trashed |

Category files screens reuse search, sort, selection, context menu, and preview. They do **not** add or import files. Counts use `fetchVaultItemsFromAllFolders()` (non-trashed). Photos = `isImage` (any `image/*`); Videos = `isVideo` (fixed MIME list, **not** every `video/*` type).

### 4.9 Trash

| ID | Feature | Behavior |
|----|---------|----------|
| T1 | Enable trash | UserDefaults `trashEnabled`; default **on** after first launch |
| T2 | Soft delete | Sets `isTrashed`, `trashedAt`; folder relationship kept when possible |
| T3 | View trash | Settings → View Trash (`TrashView`) with count |
| T4 | Restore | Clears trash flags (single or multi-select) |
| T5 | Permanent delete | From trash |
| T6 | Empty trash | Bulk permanent delete |
| T7 | Disable trash with items | Alert **Empty Trash & Disable**; cannot disable while keeping trash contents |
| T8 | Delete with trash off | Deletes the item and its on-disk ciphertext and thumbnail immediately |

### 4.10 Preview and media playback

| ID | Feature | Behavior | Apple APIs |
|----|---------|----------|------------|
| P1 | Unified media viewer | Horizontal paging through the current list of photos/videos (gallery/folder pass the filtered media set; File Preview passes a **single** item) | SwiftUI `scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)` |
| P2 | Photo zoom / pan | Pinch, pan, bounds clamping, **double-tap** toggles 1×/2×; zoom disables horizontal paging | `ZoomablePhotoView` (gestures, not `UIScrollView`) |
| P3 | Video autoplay | Page plays when it becomes current (`isActive`) | `AutoPlayVideoView`, `AVPlayer` |
| P4 | Custom video controls | Play/pause, ±15s, scrubber, rates 0.25–2.0×, auto-hide; **pinch/pan and double-tap zoom** on the video surface | `PlayerControlsView`, `AutoPlayVideoView` |
| P5 | File info panel | Name, MIME, size, folder path, created, modified (if another day), favorite | `FileInfoPanel` |
| P6 | Viewer actions | Favorite, Share, dismiss | SwiftUI |
| P7 | Image/video from File Preview | Single-item `UnifiedMediaViewerView` (no sibling paging) | same |
| P8 | Document preview | PDF via PDFKit; plain text in-app; other documents QuickLook | PDFKit, QuickLook |
| P9 | Audio preview | Decrypt to temp file; play/pause/seek; `AVAudioSession` category `.playback` | AVKit, AVFoundation |
| P10 | Unsupported types | Placeholder + QuickLook fallback | QuickLook |
| P11 | Preview loading / error | Dedicated loading and error views | SwiftUI |

Playback decrypts to a temporary file; original vault file stays encrypted.

### 4.11 Web upload (LAN HTTPS server)

| ID | Feature | Behavior | Apple APIs |
|----|---------|----------|------------|
| W1 | Start / stop server | Toggle; shows URL `https://<LAN-IP>:8080` and the SHA-256 fingerprint of the session certificate | `NWListener` + `NWProtocolTLS`, port **8080**, `includePeerToPeer = true` |
| W1b | TLS | Each start mints an ECDSA P-256 self-signed certificate with SAN for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and the Wi-Fi IPv4 address. The private key is ThisDeviceOnly in Keychain and is deleted when the server stops. Browsers show a trust warning because there is no public CA. | `LANWebTLSIdentity`, Security |
| W2 | Copy URL | Clipboard + light haptic | UIPasteboard |
| W3 | QR code | QR of the HTTPS server URL | Core Image `CIQRCodeGenerator` |
| W4 | Help / instructions | Same-WiFi upload steps, including how to accept the HTTPS warning | SwiftUI sheet |
| W5 | Pairing | 6-digit code shown in the app; browser posts it to `/pair` (5 attempts) for a session cookie | `WebAccessControl` |
| W5b | Export session | Downloads stay off until Face ID / Touch ID or the vault credential unlocks a 10-minute window; ends on background or Stop Downloads | LocalAuthentication, Keychain |
| W6 | Browser UI | Folder browse, breadcrumbs, upload, manage when not fake login. Explorer, status, and success pages use the same teal/mint/green palette as the app; destructive actions remain red | `WebServerHTMLGenerator`, `WebServerHTMLComponents` |
| W6b | Browser drag and drop | Dragging files or folders anywhere over the explorer shows a “Drop to upload” overlay naming the destination folder. Dropping opens the upload dialog and starts the upload straight away; dropped directories keep their structure | `WebServerHTMLGenerator` |
| W7 | Block fake login | UI disabled; HTTP 403 | — |
| W8 | Background keep-alive | `UIBackgroundTask` named `WebServerUpload` while uploads are in flight, so a transfer that is already running survives a short trip away from the app. The server needs the app open; it does not accept new uploads once iOS suspends the app | UIKit background task |
| W9 | Background URLSession | Session id `com.haresh.keepshire.background-upload`; POST `/upload`; trusts only this session’s TLS certificate | `URLSessionConfiguration.background` |
| W10 | Large uploads | `POST /upload` with Content-Length **> 100MB** (`100 * 1024 * 1024`) switches to `handleLargeFileUpload`. Browser can also `POST /upload/stream` | custom HTTP |
| W11 | Gallery web-upload sheet | Same server controls as the tab, presented from Gallery Add Content | `WebUploadView` |
| W12 | Device locked | While the device is locked, vault files are unreadable and unwritable, so every route that touches them answers **503** with “iPhone is locked. Unlock it to continue, then try again.” Any open export session ends. Routes resume as soon as the device unlocks | `protectedDataWillBecomeUnavailableNotification` |

HTTP routes. Transport is TLS. Every route except `POST /pair` requires the session token (header `X-Vault-Token`, session cookie on GET, or `?token=` on GET). The session cookie is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, and `Secure`. Fake login returns 403 on every route.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/pair` | Exchange pairing code for session cookie (public; attempt-capped) |
| GET | `/`, `/upload` | Upload HTML |
| GET | `/test`, `/status` | Diagnostics |
| GET | `/api/session` | Whether an export session is active |
| POST | `/upload` | Multipart upload |
| POST | `/upload/stream` | Streaming upload |
| POST | `/api/folder/create` | Create folder |
| POST | `/api/folder/rename` | Rename folder |
| POST | `/api/folder/delete` | Delete folder |
| POST | `/api/file/delete` | Delete file |
| POST | `/api/bulk/delete` | Bulk delete |
| POST | `/api/download/ticket` | Issue a one-shot download ticket for one file, one folder, or a selection (export session required) |
| GET | `/download/t/{ticket}` | Redeem ticket (single use, client-bound, 60s) |

Security notice in UI: local network only; files encrypted after arrival. The hop from browser to phone is HTTPS with a per-session certificate created on the device (browser warning expected; fingerprint shown in the app). Downloads use single-use tickets while an export session is open. Download Selected sends the whole selection on one ticket and returns a single `Keepshire Selection.zip`. Folder and selection ZIPs stage files with complete file protection and delete the staging directory afterward.

### 4.12 Notifications and haptics

| ID | Feature | Behavior | APIs |
|----|---------|----------|------|
| N1 | Notification permission | Requested when the user starts Web Upload for the first time: alert, badge, sound. Launch and unlock do not prompt. If permission was refused, starting the server shows a banner that opens Settings when tapped | UserNotifications, `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString` |
| N2 | In-app toasts | Upload start, 25/50/75/100% milestones, completion. A banner with an action is tappable and shows a chevron; the rest carry a close button and let touches reach the vault underneath | `NotificationOverlayView` |
| N3 | System notification | Posted on upload completion when the app is not on screen, so the in-app banner and a system banner never duplicate each other. A notification that arrives while the app is on screen is still presented as a banner with sound | `UNUserNotificationCenter`, `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` |
| N4 | Upload progress cards | Bottom overlay from `uploadProgress` dictionary | `UploadProgressOverlayView` |
| N5 | Haptics | First Gallery selection: **medium**; security lock: **heavy**; copy URL: **light** | `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` |

### 4.13 Settings (real login)

| Section | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| Security | Current method; Change Authentication; Fake password set/change/remove; Auto-Lock picker; Biometric toggle + availability (Face ID vs Touch ID) |
| Advanced Security | Screenshot, recording, shake, flip toggles + help text |
| Trash | Enable; View Trash + count |
| Lock Behavior | Read-only restatement of current timeout |
| Disk | Total files; total size (encrypted files + thumbnails) |
| About | Marketing version + build number from the bundle; Privacy Policy and Support open https://keepshire.haresh.dev/privacy and https://keepshire.haresh.dev/support |
| Developer (DEBUG only) | Complete App Reset (`exit(0)` after wipe); Simulate First Launch Cleanup; Delete All Files & Folders (keeps passcode/settings) |

All three delete vault files and thumbnails from disk before clearing metadata. Delete All Files & Folders ignores the trash setting and keeps the encryption key loaded, so imports work without unlocking again.

Fake login: **About only**.

### 4.14 Cross-cutting UX

| ID | Feature | Behavior |
|----|---------|----------|
| X1 | Alerts | SwiftUI `.alert` on folder, gallery, category, trash, and settings screens; `FolderViewModel` implements `AlertManageable` |
| X2 | Sheets | SwiftUI `.sheet` / `.fullScreenCover` for pickers, add content, web upload, trash, and auth change |
| X3 | Dark mode | System SwiftUI colors (`Color(.systemGray6)`, etc.) plus `KeepshireTheme`, which supplies light/dark brand colours from the asset catalog (`AccentColor`, `BrandGreen`). No custom theme engine and no per-user theme setting |
| X3a | Brand palette | Colours are sampled from the app icon. Teal accent for actions, selection, folders, and progress; green reserved for success/protected states; the icon gradient appears only on authentication, the privacy cover, and branded empty states. File-type and category colours stay distinct on purpose |
| X4 | Orientations | iPhone: portrait + landscape; iPad: all four |
| X5 | Localization | English source strings use string catalogs in the app and Share Extension; layouts use leading/trailing semantics and the numeric keypad intentionally stays left-to-right. |
| X6 | Accessibility | Auth choices, secret passcode entry count, number pad, vault/folder rows, preview actions, trash actions, web upload, and player controls have VoiceOver labels. Number-pad keys and passcode fields scale with Dynamic Type and retain 44-point targets. |
| X7 | Dynamic Type | SwiftUI text styles plus scaled passcode fields and keypad controls; auth setup remains usable at accessibility sizes. |
| X8 | iPad | Regular-width iPad uses native adaptive tabs and split layouts: a nested Folder outline, category/sidebar navigation, Gallery and Trash grid/detail previews, sectioned Settings, and embedded file/media previews. Compact iPad windows retain the iPhone stacks. Web Upload uses a centered readable column. Multiple scenes remain disabled. |
| X9 | Share Extension import | The extension copies supported files to `group.com.haresh.keepshire/Inbox/<session>/` without vault or Keychain access. The app drains the inbox on a real unlock, and also on foreground when the vault is still unlocked inside the auto-lock window; fake-vault unlocks never drain it. |
| X10 | Gallery thumbnail cache | Gallery fetches all non-trashed items and selects photos/videos in memory, because `fileType` lives in sealed metadata and cannot be filtered by a store predicate. Thumbnails decrypt lazily per visible cell; the decrypted data is memory-cached and purged whenever the vault locks or the key changes. |
| X11 | Diagnostics | MetricKit crash/hang delivery only. The app stores the last delivery date and does not record vault analytics, file names, paths, or content. |

## 5. Data model

### Folder

| Attribute | Type |
|-----------|------|
| id | UUID |
| name | String (empty at rest; decrypted into RAM after unlock) |
| sealedMetadata | Binary (AES-GCM JSON `{name}`) |
| createdAt, updatedAt | Date |
| items | to-many VaultItem, **cascade** delete |
| parent | to-one Folder, **nullify** |
| subfolders | to-many Folder, **cascade** delete |

### VaultItem

| Attribute | Type |
|-----------|------|
| id | UUID |
| fileName, fileType, thumbnailFileName | String (empty at rest; decrypted into RAM after unlock) |
| fileSize | Int64 (0 at rest; decrypted into RAM after unlock) |
| sealedMetadata | Binary (AES-GCM JSON of name, MIME, size, thumbnail filename) |
| isFavorite, isTrashed | Bool (default false) |
| createdAt, updatedAt, trashedAt | Date |
| folder | to-one Folder, **nullify** |

Store name: `Keepshire`. Class codegen: manual (`Folder+CoreData*`, `VaultItem+CoreData*`).

## 7. What this app does **not** include

These are confirmed absences. Do not treat them as regressions unless product adds them later.

- Camera capture, scanning, or microphone recording
- iCloud Drive / CloudKit / iCloud Keychain sync of vault files
- Action Extension, Widgets, Live Activities, App Intents / Siri
- Multiple windows / document-based `DocumentGroup`
- Optic ID (visionOS) — Face ID / Touch ID only
- PIN from system `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthentication` as the primary unlock UI
- Per-file passwords, hidden albums beyond fake-login, or dual encrypted stores
- Contacts, calendar, location, Bluetooth peripherals
- Analytics / crash SDKs
- On-device ML / Vision / Photos intelligence features
- Localization beyond English source strings

## 8. Tests that must keep passing

| Target | Coverage (current files) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| KeepshireTests | Keychain (including derivation record), Core Data save-without-crash, storage/crypto/thumbnails/trash, chunked vault blobs, tmp share sweep, fail-closed passcode migration, VaultCryptoService PBKDF2, Security, Biometric, authentication coordination, shared imports, Folder and VaultMain view models, WebServer HTML/HTTP helpers, DI, EmptyState, video lifecycle |
| KeepshireUITests | First-launch authentication, tab/navigation, fake-vault restrictions, add controls, and launch smoke tests |

Upgrade work should run unit tests on the new SDK simulator and a smoke pass of UI tests. Tests are not a substitute for the checklist below.

## 9. Upgrade verification checklist

Use this for iOS 27, 28, 29, or any Xcode bump. Check every box against a **device and simulator** of the new OS.

**Auth & lock**

- [ ] First-launch auth type + 4-digit, 6-digit, and password setup
- [ ] Unlock with credential; Face ID; Touch ID (if hardware exists)
- [ ] Biometric cancel → passcode; 3 failures → 30s block
- [ ] Auto-lock: immediate, 30s, never
- [ ] App Switcher does not reveal vault contents
- [ ] Change auth re-encrypts files; old credential cannot decrypt
- [ ] Fake password: empty UI, no add, no web server, About-only settings
- [ ] Shake to lock / flip to lock when enabled
- [ ] Screenshot protection on: vault stays visible, Photos gets a blank image, alert says the shot is blank
- [ ] Sheets and full-screen previews are also blank in the screenshot; the lock screen is visually unchanged
- [ ] Screenshot protection off: screenshot contains the vault; no blanking alert
- [ ] Screenshot and recording toggles still match after relaunch

**Files**

- [ ] PHPicker import up to 50 photos/videos; HEIC/JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP; MOV/MP4
- [ ] Document picker: PDF, text, Office-like, zip, audio
- [ ] Duplicate and rename-collision behavior unchanged
- [ ] Nested folders: create, rename, move (no cycle), delete + trash rules, swipe-to-delete
- [ ] Gallery, Category, and Folder search (file and immediate child-folder names)
- [ ] Sort, multi-select, share, favorite (Gallery, Folders, Categories)
- [ ] Categories counts and filters
- [ ] Trash restore / empty / disable-with-contents alert

**Preview**

- [ ] Photo pinch/pan/double-tap zoom and paging
- [ ] Video play, scrub, ±15s, speed menu, autoplay next, pinch/double-tap zoom
- [ ] Audio play/seek
- [ ] PDF/QuickLook
- [ ] Share decrypts a usable temp file

**Web & background**

- [ ] Start server; HTTPS URL + QR open from another device on Wi‑Fi after accepting the certificate warning
- [ ] Upload small and >100MB files; folder CRUD from browser
- [ ] Downloads remain off by default; work when enabled
- [ ] Fake login cannot start server
- [ ] Backgrounding during an in-flight upload: the transfer finishes inside the short window iOS grants, and a system notification arrives
- [ ] Local network permission prompt (if the new OS requires it) does not break start/stop

**Data integrity**

- [ ] Existing vault from a previous OS **on the same bundle ID** `com.haresh.keepshire` still unlocks with the same credential (PBKDF2 salt in Keychain, or SHA-256 ciphertext rewritten on first unlock)
- [ ] A leftover `com.haresh.FileVault` install is a separate app and does not share this vault
- [ ] Thumbnails still load; Core Data store migrates without loss
- [ ] Keychain items survive the upgrade (same bundle ID), including `vaultKeyDerivation`

**Build**

- [ ] Warn-as-known: deprecations listed in [IOS_27_UPGRADE_PLAN.md](IOS_27_UPGRADE_PLAN.md) only
- [ ] No new unprotected network endpoints (LAN server is opt-in HTTPS; `POST /pair` is the only public route and is attempt-capped)

## 10. Known source/docs mismatches (not upgrade work)

Recorded so upgrades do not “fix” the wrong thing:

1. `KeepshireApp` notes that background URLSession events are not handled via `AppDelegate`.
2. MIME mismatches: `isAudio` includes `audio/x-m4a` / ogg / flac, but `determineFileType` maps `.m4a` → `audio/mp4` and has **no** ogg/flac/zip/rtf/Office cases (those become `application/octet-stream` → **Other** unless another importer supplies a MIME).
3. `LoginStateManager.visibleSettingSections` omits Trash and does not drive `SettingsView` (the view uses `canAccessFullSettings` instead).

---

## 11. Open questions (need product confirmation)

If any of these are wrong, say so and this catalog will be corrected:

1. **Fake vault:** Confirm it is intentionally a *UI disguise* (empty lists), not a second encrypted dataset.
2. **Camera:** Confirm there is no in-app camera and we should not add one during OS upgrades.
3. **Optic ID / visionOS / Mac Catalyst:** In or out of scope for upcoming upgrades?
4. **Minimum OS after upgrade:** Keep supporting iOS 18.5, or raise the deployment target to the new OS only?

---

## 12. Maintenance rule

Any PR that adds, removes, or changes a user-visible behavior must update:

- This file (`docs/FEATURES.md`)
- The upgrade verification checklist if a new testable behavior appears
- README only for marketing-level changes (keep this file as the source of truth)
