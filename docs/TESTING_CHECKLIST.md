# Testing Checklist - Core Features

Use this checklist against a simulator or device. Automated coverage lives in `KeepshireTests` (run serially) and `KeepshireUITests`.

Home screen shows **Keepshire**. Face ID and local-network prompts use that name. This bundle ID is a fresh vault.

## Pre-test

- [ ] Project opens in Xcode
- [ ] App builds (Cmd+B)
- [ ] App runs on simulator or device (Cmd+R)

Face ID, local network, and launch screen strings are already in `Keepshire/Info.plist`.

## First launch

1. [ ] Delete the app (or use DEBUG Settings → Simulate First Launch Cleanup)
2. [ ] Launch: **Security Setup** with 4-digit passcode, 6-digit passcode, and password
3. [ ] Continue into setup:
   - [ ] 4-digit: exact length, confirm match
   - [ ] 6-digit: exact length, confirm match
   - [ ] Password: minimum 6 characters, confirm match
4. [ ] After setup, the five tabs appear: Folder, Category, Gallery, Web Upload, Settings

## Main tabs

1. [ ] Folder: empty-state create folder / add files; nested folders; swipe delete
2. [ ] Category: Favorites, Photos, Videos, Audio, Documents, Other, All Files
3. [ ] Gallery: grid, search, add content (photos/videos, files, web upload)
4. [ ] Web Upload: start/stop server, URL, QR; fake login cannot start the server
5. [ ] Settings: Security, Advanced Security, Trash, disk usage, About version matches the built marketing version and build number

## Auto-lock

Default timeout is **30 seconds**. Options: Immediately, 5s, 10s, 15s, 30s, 1 min, 5 min, Never.

1. [ ] Immediately: return from background → credential (or biometrics)
2. [ ] 30 seconds: return before 30s → stay unlocked; after 30s → lock
3. [ ] Never: return after a long wait → stay unlocked

## Privacy overlay

- [ ] App Switcher preview does not show vault contents (lock cover); the cover is fully opaque, with no vault content faintly visible through it

## Biometrics

Simulator: Features → Face ID → Enrolled / Matching Face / Non-matching Face. Prefer a physical device.

1. [ ] Settings toggle matches hardware (Face ID or Touch ID)
2. [ ] After timeout, biometric prompt runs first
3. [ ] Cancel biometric → passcode/password UI
4. [ ] Success unlocks the real vault

## Unlock

1. [ ] Fresh install selects 6-digit passcode by default and shows the no-recovery warning
2. [ ] 4-digit remains selectable and is described as weaker
3. [ ] Setup warns before saving: forgotten passcode/password means files cannot be recovered
4. [ ] Wrong credential → error, fields clear
5. [ ] Correct credential → tabs
6. [ ] Fake password (if set) → empty UI, no add, no web server, Settings About only

## Change authentication

- [ ] Change method in Settings re-encrypts files
- [ ] If re-encrypt cannot finish, the old credential still opens files
- [ ] Old credential cannot decrypt after a successful change
- [ ] Fake password is cleared

## Vault encryption

- [ ] New install: import a photo, lock, unlock — file still opens
- [ ] Settings → Change Authentication: files still open with the new credential; the old one does not
- [ ] Vault that existed before PBKDF2: first unlock after this build still shows files (may pause briefly while files are rewritten)
- [ ] Imported file keeps its name in Gallery; the file in `Documents/Vault/` is a UUID, not `vacation.jpg`
- [ ] Rename in the app changes the Gallery name; the UUID blob on disk stays the same
- [ ] Older vault files named after the display name still open after first unlock (they are moved to UUID)
- [ ] Import a photo: Gallery thumbnail shows; `Documents/Thumbnails/{uuid}.thumb` is not a JPEG on disk
- [ ] Vault that had plaintext thumbs: first unlock still shows thumbnails (files are rewritten under AES-GCM)
- [ ] After unlock, Gallery search still matches the original filename
- [ ] Lock the device, inspect `Keepshire.sqlite` (or a Core Data dump): `fileName` / folder `name` are empty; `sealedMetadata` is present
- [ ] Share a file, cancel the sheet, lock the app: no decrypted file remains under `tmp/keepshire-share/`
- [ ] Import a video from Photos; the app stays running (does not jetsam on a large clip under 2 GB)
- [ ] Files larger than 2 GB fail import with an error

## Files and folders

- [ ] Import up to 50 photos/videos; document picker
- [ ] Nested folders: create, rename, move, delete
- [ ] Gallery and category search; folder search matches files and immediate child folders
- [ ] On a physical device, the Folder search field is visible on the tab's first appearance and collapses once the list is scrolled, matching Gallery and the system apps
- [ ] Folder search still works from the empty and no-results states
- [ ] Folder tab shows its title on first load, and pushing into a nested folder does not flash "Folders" before the folder name
- [ ] VoiceOver announces passcode progress without speaking digits
- [ ] Largest Dynamic Type keeps the number pad and Continue controls usable
- [ ] Sort (including Duration), multi-select, favorite, share, rename, move
- [ ] Trash restore / empty / disable with contents
- [ ] Trash off: delete a file and confirm its `Documents/Vault/` blob and `Documents/Thumbnails/` thumb are gone
- [ ] Unlock clears vault files and thumbnails that belong to no item

## Preview

- [ ] Photo pinch, pan, double-tap zoom, swipe between items
- [ ] Video play/pause, scrubber, ±15s, speed, pinch/double-tap zoom
- [ ] Audio; PDF; other documents via QuickLook

## Share Extension

- [ ] Share an image, video, PDF, and generic file to Keepshire
- [ ] Before unlock, files remain only in the App Group inbox
- [ ] Fake-vault unlock does not import or remove pending files
- [ ] Real-vault unlock encrypts pending files into the root folder and removes the inbox session
- [ ] Sharing and returning to an already-unlocked vault (inside the auto-lock window) still imports
- [ ] Force-quit during staging/import; retry does not lose a pending file

## iPad and localization

- [ ] Regular-width iPad Folder tab shows the nested folder outline, folder content, and selected-file preview; sidebar and breadcrumbs stay synchronized
- [ ] Gallery and Trash show grid + preview detail; Categories show category + files + preview columns
- [ ] Settings sidebar opens Authentication, Security, Data/Trash, Web/Background, and About without exposing full settings in the fake vault
- [ ] Media and document previews have an explicit close control and file information remains usable with pointer/keyboard input
- [ ] Web Upload and shared sheets use readable form widths rather than stretching edge to edge
- [ ] Rotate iPad through all supported orientations and resize through Stage Manager/Split View; compact width falls back to the phone stack without stale selection
- [ ] iPhone navigation, tab identifiers, search, selection, and full-screen previews are unchanged
- [ ] Only one scene/window is offered
- [ ] Pseudolanguage and right-to-left launch: labels fit, navigation direction mirrors, keypad stays ordered 1–9

## Gallery performance and diagnostics

- [ ] Gallery shows every photo and video after unlock, and excludes documents and audio
- [ ] Gallery search and every sort option cover the whole vault, not just what is on screen
- [ ] Duration sort: non-videos (0:00) first when ascending and last when descending; equal durations order by file size
- [ ] Video thumbnails show duration in the top-left corner
- [ ] Locking clears decrypted thumbnail memory; thumbnails reload after unlock
- [ ] Changing the passcode does not show a thumbnail decrypted under the old key
- [ ] MetricKit diagnostic delivery records only its delivery date; no vault analytics or file metadata are logged

## Web upload

- [ ] Explorer, upload dialog, status page, and success page use the Keepshire teal/mint/green palette; destructive actions remain red
- [ ] Drag files over the explorer: the "Drop to upload" overlay names the folder being viewed and disappears when the drag leaves the window
- [ ] Drop files on the explorer: one dialog opens, shows per-file and overall progress, and the files land in the folder being viewed
- [ ] Drop a folder on the explorer: subfolders are recreated in the vault
- [ ] Fresh install: launch and unlock do not request notification permission; starting Web Upload requests it once
- [ ] Upload with the app on screen: in-app completion banner appears, no duplicate system banner
- [ ] Upload while the app is in the App Switcher: a system notification arrives, as long as the transfer finishes within the short window iOS allows a backgrounded app
- [ ] Lock the device, then upload from the browser: the page says the iPhone is locked instead of a file-permission error, and any export session has ended
- [ ] Unlock the device and retry the same upload: it succeeds without restarting the server
- [ ] With notifications refused in Settings: starting the server shows a banner that opens this app's Settings page when tapped
- [ ] Banners without an action still let taps reach the screen underneath
- [ ] Start server on port 8080; open the **https** URL from another device on the same Wi‑Fi
- [ ] Browser warns about the certificate; accept it, then enter the 6-digit pairing code; uploads work after pairing
- [ ] Downloads stay hidden until Allow Downloads is confirmed with Face ID or the vault credential
- [ ] After that, per-file/folder download icons and Download Selected appear; they vanish when the session ends
- [ ] Download Selected with several files and folders picked returns one ZIP named Keepshire Selection.zip containing every pick
- [ ] Upload small and large files

## Device security

- [ ] Screenshot protection on: vault stays visible; the image in Photos is blank; one alert says the shot is blank, and one entry lands in the security log
- [ ] Lock screen, sheets (Settings, Web Upload, pickers), and full-screen previews look normal on the device and are blank in the screenshot
- [ ] Screenshot protection off: no blanking alert; screenshot can include the vault
- [ ] Screenshot and recording toggles still match after relaunch
- [ ] Screen recording overlay when that toggle is on; it stays up after switching apps and back, and when a recording is already running at launch
- [ ] Shake to lock / flip to lock when enabled

## Developer (DEBUG)

- [ ] Complete App Reset → Security Setup on relaunch; `Documents/Vault/` and `Documents/Thumbnails/` are empty
- [ ] Delete All Files & Folders keeps the credential and empties both storage directories, with trash on and off

## App Store compliance

- [ ] Home screen icon is labeled Keepshire
- [ ] Face ID prompt says “unlock Keepshire”
- [ ] Local-network prompt names Keepshire
- [ ] iPad does not offer a second app window
- [ ] Archive contains `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` with UserDefaults reason CA92.1 and no tracking declaration
- [ ] Archive Info.plist has `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = YES`
- [ ] Release run emits no verbose vault request, path, filename, or security-state diagnostics
- [ ] Settings → About: Privacy Policy opens https://keepshire.haresh.dev/privacy and Support opens https://keepshire.haresh.dev/support
- [ ] App Store Connect export answers, privacy answers, review notes, and URLs match the app and developer guide

## Automated tests

```sh
xcodebuild -project "Keepshire.xcodeproj" -scheme "Keepshire" \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 18 Pro' \
  test -only-testing:"KeepshireTests" -parallel-testing-enabled NO
```

- [ ] Unit tests pass serially
- [ ] UI tests on iPhone and iPad: first-launch auth, tabs, fake vault, add controls
